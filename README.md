# Uint 6 - Trivia
By Marrit Leenstra

## Introduction
With this app you can play a quiz game that will ask the user trivia questions. The questions are retrieved through the API of jservice.io. 
When users answer these questions correctly they earn points. The game finishes by a wrong answer, at which point users are presented 
with their earned points. These points are contained in a leaderboard, which is stored in an online database Firebase.
